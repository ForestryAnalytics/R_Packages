## itcIMG: Individual Tree Crowns segmentation with imagery data

The ITC delineation approach finds local maxima within an imagery, designates these as tree tops, then uses a decision
tree method to grow individual crowns around the local maxima.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
itcIMG(imagery = NULL, epsg = NULL, searchWinSize = 3, TRESHSeed = 0.45,
  TRESHCrown = 0.55, DIST = 10, th = 0, ischm = FALSE)
</code></pre>
#### Arguments
imagery
An object of class raster on which to perform the segmentation. The image should be projected.
epsg
The EPSG code of the reference system of the image.
searchWinSize
Size (in pixels) of the moving window used to the detect the local maxima. It should be an odd number larger than 3.
TRESHSeed
Growing threshold 1. It should be between 0 and 1.
TRESHCrown
Growing threshold 2. It should be between 0 and 1.
DIST
Maximum value of the crown diameter of a detected tree (in meters).
th
Digital number value below which a pixel cannot be a local maxima.
ischm
TRUE if the imagery is a Canopy Height Model (CHM). Default: FALSE.

#### Value

An object of the class SpatialPolygonsDataFrame containing the delineated ITCs. The informaion for each ITC contained in the data frame are the X and Y coordinates position of the tree, the tree height in meters (Height_m; only if ischm=TRUE) and its crown area in square meters (CA_m2).
