## ``loglogistic`` Log-logistic growth model

#### Description: Computes the Log-logistic growth model
\[y(t) = 1 + exp(??klog(t)\]

### Usage 
<pre><code>
loglogistic(t, alpha, beta, k)
loglogistic.inverse(x, alpha, beta, k)
</code></pre>
### Arguments 
*``t``: time
*``x``: size
*``alpha``: upper asymptote
*``beta``: growth range
*``k``: growth rate

### Examples
```{r}
growth <- loglogistic(0:10, 10, 0.5, 0.3)
# Calculate inverse function
time <- loglogistic.inverse(growth, 10, 0.5, 0.3)
```
