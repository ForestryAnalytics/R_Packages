Description
Developed for the following tasks. I) Computing the probability density function, cumulative distribution
function, random generation, and estimating the parameters of the eleven mixture models
including mixture of Birnbaum-Saunders, BurrXII, Chen, F, Frechet, gamma, Gompertz, loglogistic,
log-normal, Lomax, and Weibull. II) Point estimation of the parameters of twoand
three-parameter Weibull distributions. In the case of two-parameter, twelve methods consist
of generalized least square type 1, generalized least square type 2, L-moment, maximum likelihood,
logarithmic moment, moment, percentile, rank correlation, least square, weighted maximum
likelihood, U-statistic, weighted least square are used and investigated methods
for the three-parameter case are: maximum likelihood, modified moment type 1, modified
moment type 2, modified moment type 3, modified maximum likelihood type 1, modified
maximum likelihood type 2, modified maximum likelihood type 3, modified maximum likelihood
type 4, moment, maximum product spacing, T-L moment, and weighted maximum likelihood.
III) The Bayesian estimators of the three-parameter Weibull distribution developed
by Green et al. (1994) <doi:10.2307/2533217>. IV) Estimating parameters of the threeparameter
Birnbaum-Saunders, generalized exponential, and Weibull distributions fitted
to grouped data using three methods including approximated maximum likelihood, expectation
maximization, and maximum likelihood. V) Estimating the parameters of the gamma, lognormal,
and Weibull mixture models fitted to the grouped data through the EM algorithm,
VI) Estimating parameters of the non-linear growth curve fitted to the height-diameter observation,
and VII) estimating parameters, computing probability density function, cumulative
distribution function, and generating realizations from gamma shape mixture model introduced
by Venturini et al. (2008) <doi:10.1214/07-AOAS156>.

DBH Trees height and diameter at breast height
Description
The DBH data contains the diameter at breast height (dbh), height and condition data for all trees
centered in 108 plots of size 0.2 hectare immediately following a single prescribed burn and also
following three 5-yr (year) interval reburns (four burns total) and a single 15-yr interval reburn
(two burns total) and associated treatment information. The trees information were established
from mixed ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) that contained scattered western
junipers (Juniperus occidentalis Hook.). The plots were located in the Malheur National Forest on
the southern end of the Blue Mountains near Burns, Oregon, USA.
Usage
data(DBH)
Format
A text file with 5732 observations from 17 variables related of trees characteristics such as dbh and
height.

family Can be either "birnbaum-saunders", "ge", or "weibull".
method1 A character string determining the method of estimation. It can be one of "aml",
"em" and "ml". The short forms "aml", "em", and "ml" are described as follows.
""aml" (for method of approximated maximum likelihood (aml)), ""em" (for
method of expectation maximization (em)), and ""ml" (for method of maximum
likelihood (ml)).
starts A numeric vector of the initial values for the shape, scale, and location parameters,
respectively.
method2 The method for optimizing the log-likelihood function. It invovles one of "BFGS",
"Nelder-Mead", "CG", "L-BFGS-B" or "SANN".

fitmixture Estimating parameters of the well-known mixture models
Description
Estimates parameters of the mixture model using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm.
General form for the cdf of a statistical mixture model is given by
F(x; ) =
XK
j=1
!jFj(x; j);
where  = (1; : : : ; K)T , is the whole parameter vector, j for j = 1; : : : ;K is the parameter
space of the j-th component, i.e. j = (j ; j)T , Fj(:; j) is the cdf of the j-th component, and
known constant K is the number of components. Parameters  and  are the shape and scale
parameters or both are the shape parameters. In the latter case, the parameters  and  are called
the first and second shape parameters, respectively. We note that the constants !js sum to one,
i.e.
PK
j=1 !j = 1. The families considered for the cdf F include Birnbaum-Saunders, Burr type
XII, Chen, F, Frechet, Gamma, Gompertz, Log-normal, Log-logistic, Lomax, skew-normal, and
Weibull.
Usage
fitmixture(data, family, K, initial=FALSE, starts)
Arguments
data Vector of observations.
family Name of the family including: "birnbaum-saunders", "burrxii", "chen", "f",
"Frechet", "gamma", "gompetrz", "log-normal", "log-logistic", "lomax",

It is worth noting that identifiability of the mixture models supposed to be held. For skew-normal
case we have j = (j ; j ; j)T in which ô€€€1 < j < 1, j > 0, and ô€€€1 < j < 1,
respectively, are the location, scale, and skewness parameters of the j-th component, see Azzalini
(1985).

fitmixturegrouped Estimating parameters of the well-known mixture models fitted to the
grouped data
Description
Estimates parameters of the gamma, log-normal, and Weibull mixture models fitted to the grouped
data using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. General form for the cdf of a statistical
mixture model is given by
F(x; ) =
XK
k=1
!kFk(x; k);
16 fitmixturegrouped
where  = (1; : : : ; K)T , is the whole parameter vector, k for k = 1; : : : ;K is the parameter
space of the j-th component, i.e. k = (k; k)T , Fj(:; j) is the cdf of the k-th component,
and known constant K is the number of components. Parameters  and  are the shape and scale
parameters. The constants !ks sum to one, i.e.
PK
k=1 !k = 1. The families considered for the
cdf F include Gamma, Log-normal, and Weibull. If a sample of n independent observations each
follows a distribution with cdf F have been divided into m separate groups of the form (riô€€€1; ri],
for i = 1; : : : ;m. So, the likelihood function of the observed data is given by

!kf(xjk)dx;
in which f(xjk) denotes the pdf of the j-th component. Using the the EM algorithm proposed by
Dempster et al. (1977), we can solve @L(jf1; : : : ; fm)=@ = 0 by introducing two new missing
variables.
Usage
fitmixturegrouped(family, r, f, K, initial=FALSE, starts)
Arguments
family Name of the family including: "gamma", "log-normal", "skew-normal", and
"weibull".
r A numeric vector of length m + 1. The first element of r is lower bound of the
first group and other m elements are upper bound of the m groups. We note that
upper bound of the (i ô€€€ 1)-th group is the lower bound of the i-th group, for
i = 2; : : : ;m. The lower bound of the first group and upper bound of the m-th
group are chosen arbitrarily. If raw data are available, the smallest and largest
observations are chosen for lower bound of the first group and upper bound of
the m-th group, respectively.
f A numeric vector of length m containing the groupâ€™s frequency.
K Number of components.
initial The sequence of initial values including !1; : : : ; !K; 1; : : : ; K; 1; : : : ; K.
For skew normal case the vector of initial values of skewness parameters will
be added. By default the initial values automatically is determind by k-means
method of clustering.
starts If initial=TRUE, then sequence of the initial values must be given.
Details
Identifiability of the mixture models supposed to be held. For skew-normal mixture model the
parameter vector of k-th component gets the form k = (k; k; k)T where k; k; and k denote
the location, scale, and skewness parameters, respectively.
fitWeibull 17
Value

18 fitWeibull
Usage
fitWeibull(data, location, method, starts)
Arguments
data Vector of observations
starts Initial values for starting the iterative procedures such as Newton-Raphson.
location Either TRUE or FALSE. If location=TRUE, then shift parameter will be considered;
otherwise the shift parameter omitted.
method Used method for estimating the parameters. In the two-parameter case, methods
are "greg1" (for the method of generalized regression type 1), "greg2" (for the
method of generalized regression type 2), "lm" (for the method of L-moment),
"ml" (for the method of maximum likelihood (ML)), "mlm" (for the method
of logarithmic moment), "moment" (for the method of moment), "pm" (for the
method of percentile), "rank" (for the method of rank correlation), "reg" (for
the method of least square), "ustat" (for the method of U-statistic), "wml" (for
the method of weighted ML), and "wreg" (for the method of weighted least
square). In three-parameter case the methods are "mle" (for the method of ML),
"mm1" (for the method of modified moment (MM) type 1), "mm2" (for the method
ofMMtype 2), "mm3" (for the method ofMMtype 3), "mml1" (for the method of
modified ML type 1), "mml2" (for the method of modified ML type 2), "mml3"

ML type 4), "moment" (for the method of moment), "mps" (for the method of
maximum product spacing), "tlm" (for the method of T-L moment), and "wml"
(for the method of weighted ML).
Details
For the method wml, all weights have been provided for sample size less that or equal to 100. This
means that both methods ml and wml give the same estimates for samples of size larger than 100.
Value
A list of objects in two parts given by the following:
1. Estimated parameters for two- or three-parameter Weibull distribution.
2. A sequence of goodness-of-fit measures consist of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Consistent
Akaike Information Criterion (CAIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Hannan-
Quinn information criterion (HQIC), Anderson-Darling (AD), Cram\â€™eer-von Misses (CVM), Kolmogorov-
