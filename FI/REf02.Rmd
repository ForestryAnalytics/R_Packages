Forest inventory equations and calculations with FI
Description
That package was created because I can’t find any free solution for these basic calculations also will
serve as learning experience to create packages in R.
Details
Here I implement the three basic volume equations (Smalian, Newton, Huber) and form and stack-
ing factors. From these you can gather many information about a region log volume (mean and
standard deviation). Later a new package will provide volumetric equations adjust.

Example of how object tree in volume function should be formated
Description
Choice of that format follow similarity with cubmaster for simplify user translation of work (export-
ing old tables). Names of columns are just cosmetic, currently I use column index. All diameters
mensures should rather be in centimeters and heights in meters
Format
A data frame with 17 rows and 6 variables
Details
• tree_number. unique number to identify tree information
• dbh. diameter at breast height
• total_height. total height of the tree. Unsed parameter in volume
• commercial_height. commercial height of tree. Unsed parameter in volume
• section_height. height of each section where diameter section is taken
• section_diameter. diameter in current height
