## volume
Estimates the stem volume

##### Description
volume uses one of the following methods (Smalian, Newton, Huber) to approximate real stem
volume. Users should remember theyâ€™re just approximations and sample size provide more accurate
results them using different methods.

#### Usage
<pre><code>
volume(trees, method = "smalian")
</code></pre>

#### Arguments
* trees a data frame or matrix in format described in dataset inventory (more help inventory)
* method method used for estimation of the stem volume


#### Examples

```{r}
example_data <- data.frame(tree_number = 1,
dhb = 5,
total_height = 20,
comercial_height = 15,
section_height = c(0,5,15),
section_diameter = 5
)volume
volume(example_data)
#
#
# A little more complex and common example
data(inventory)
volume_output <- volume(inventory)
summary(volume_output)
hist(volume_output)
```
##### Value
a named vector of volumes, names are defined as same as in first column

#### Note
Newton and Huber methods have small modifications for working just with two mensures (lower and upper diameter). Both of them use mean instead of real middle diameter.
