## ``sp.sums.2``
sp.sums.2 Generates species summaries from a dataframe that contains stem
measurements.
### Description
This function generates a dataframe object that contains the original stem measurements and appends
columns named by log.grades, where log.grades corresponds to the minimum log diameters
defined by log.breaks.
Usage
<pre><code>
sp.sums.2( x,
 log.breaks=c(2,5,12,18,32,999),
 log.grades=c("pulp","s4","s3","s2","s1","peeler") )
</code></pre>
### Arguments
x The dataframe containing the original stem measurements.
* ``log.breaks`` The vector defining the minimum diameters for the log grades defined by log.grades.
* ``log.grades`` The vector defining the text labels for the log.breaks.
### Details
The function generates summaries, by species, for common statistics used in growth and yield
simulations. It performs the same function as the sp.sums function in the Rconifers library.
### Value
A dataframe that contains the original stem measurements with the log volumes appended for each
species.

### Examples
```{r}
# test <- data.frame(a = c(1,2), b = c(3,4))
# show.cols.with.na(test)
# is.na(test$a[2]) <- TRUE
# show.cols.with.na(test)

SSallometric Self-starting version of the allometric function y = a x^b.
### Description
This function is used for fitting the allometric function to bivaraite data. The function is of the form
y = alpha x ^ beta, where traditionally x and y are different dimensions of a sampling unit, such as
diameter and volume of a tree.

### Usage
<pre><code>
SSallometric(x, alpha, beta)
</code></pre>
### Arguments
x predictor variable (e.g. volume)
alpha product parameter
beta exponent parameter
### Value
The function returns a numeric vector of response variables. The vector has two additional attributes:
the gradient, which reports the first derivative of the function with respect to the parameters,
evaluated at the response ### Value; and the hessian, which reports the matrix of second partial
derivatives of the function with respect to the parameters evaluated at the response variable.
Note
Demonstrates construction and usage of self-starting functions using selfStart.

SSallometric(10, 2, 3)
data(sweetgum)
nls(vol.m3 ~ SSallometric(dbh.cm, alpha, beta), data = sweetgum)
```


##``vol.fvs.ni.m3`` 
Predicts volume (m^3) from diameter (cm) and height (m) by species,
using functions from Wykoff et al. (1982).
### Description
This vectorized function uses models and parameter estimates from Wykoff et al. (1982) to predict
tree volumes given tree heights (m) and over-bark diameter measurements (cm) taken at 1.37 m
(4’6”). The function vol.fvs.ni.bdft performs the computation in imperial units, and vol.fvs.ni.m3
is a wrapper for convenience.


### Usage
<pre><code>
vol.fvs.ni.m3(spp, dbh.cm, ht.m)
vol.fvs.ni.bdft(spp, dbh.in, ht.ft)
</code><pre>
### Arguments
* ``spp``: Tree species. Must be one of: WP, WL, DF, GF, WH, WC, LP, ES, SF, PP, MH
* ``dbh.cm``: Tree diameter, cm, measured at 1.37 m. from the ground.
* ``dbh.in``: Tree diameter, in., measured at 1.37 m. from the ground.
* ``ht.m``: Tree height, m.
* ``ht.ft``: Tree height, ft.

### Details
The species are: WP = white pine, WL = western larch, DF = Douglas-fir, GF = grand fir, WH =
western hemlock, WC = western red cedar, LP = lodgepole pine, ES = Engelmann spruce, SF =
subalpine fir, PP = ponderosa pine, and MH = mountain hemlock.
### Value
The function returns a vector of tree volumes, in cubic metres.
Note
The function doesn’t perform any input checks. Caveat computator.
