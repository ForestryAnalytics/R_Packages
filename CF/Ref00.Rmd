Description This project provides a group of new functions to calculate the
outputs of the two main components of the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating
System (CFFDRS) at various time scales: the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System and
the Fire Behaviour Prediction (FBP) System. Some functions have two versions,
table and raster based.

Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System
Description
The cffdrs package allows R users to calculate the outputs of the two main components of the Cana-
dian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS; http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/
summary/fdr): the Fire Weather Index (FWI) System (http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/
summary/fwi) and the Fire Behaviour Prediction (FBP) System (http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.
ca/background/summary/fbp) along with additional methods created and used Canadian fire mod-
elling. These systems are widely used internationally to assess fire danger (FWI System) and quan-
tify fire behavior (FBP System).
The FWI System (Van Wagner 1987) is based on the moisture content and the effect of wind of
three classes of forest fuels on fire behavior. It consists of six components: three fuel moisture
codes (Fire Fuel Moisture Code, Duff Moisture Code, Drought Code), and three fire behavior in-
dexes representing rate of spread (Initial Spread Index), fuel consumption (Buildup Index), and firecffdrs-package

intensity (Fire Weather Index). The FWI System outputs are determined from daily noon weather
observations: temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour rainfall.
The FBP System (Forestry Canada Fire Danger Group 1992; Hirsch 1996) provides a set of primary
and secondary measures of fire behavior. The primary outputs consist of estimates of fire spread
rate, fuel consumption, fire intensity, and fire description (i.e., surface, intermittent, or crown fire).
The secondary outputs, which are not used nearly as often, give estimates of fire area, perimeter,
perimeter growth rate, and flank and back fire behavior based on a simple elliptical fire growth
model. Unlike the FWI System, which is weather based, the FBP System also requires information
on vegetation (hereafter, fuel types) and slope (if any) to calculate its outputs. Sixteen fuel types
are included in the FBP System, covering mainly major vegetation types in Canada.

This package includes eleven functions. Seven functions, fwi, fwiRaster, hffmc, hffmcRaster,
sdmc, gfmc, and wDC are used for FWI System calculation, whereas two functions, fbp and fbpRaster
are used for FBP System calculation. One function, fireSeason determines fire season start and
end dates based on weather. Two functions pros and lros are rate of spread and direction cal-
culations across tiangles. These functions are not fully independent: their inputs overlap greatly
and the users will have to provide FWI System outputs to calculate FBP System outputs. The fwi,
fwiRaster, and sdmc functions calculate the outputs based on daily noon local standard time (LST)
weather observations of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and 24-hour rainfall, as well
as the previous day’s moisture content. The hffmc, gfmc, and hffmcRaster functions calculate the
outputs based on hourly weather observations of temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and
hourly rainfall, as well as the previous hour’s weather conditions. The fbp and fbpRaster functions
calculate the outputs of the FBP System based on given set of information about fire weather con-
ditions (weather observations and their associated FWI System components), fuel type, and slope
(optional).

Examples
#Calculating daily FWI with wintering DC
#This exercise demonstrates how to calculate daily FWI System variables given a chronical two years
# daily fire weather observations from one weather station. In the example, we showed first how to
# decide fire season start and end dates with fireSeason, we then made overwintering DC adjustment
# with wDC for the second fire season, and eventually calculated the daily FWI System variables over
# two fire seasons with fwi. All these steps were packed up into an example user's function, which
# could be modified by various user groups. Note: the data used in this example is also the test
# data for wDC.

# Load the test dataset, which is also the test data for wDC:
data("test_wDC")
#select 1 weather station
localWX_1 <- test_wDC[test_wDC$id==1,]
#run function with the data and fire season values
fwi_withFSwDC <- fwi_fs_wDC(localWX_1)
#Check the resulting fwi indices, calculated with a fire season start and end date, and using
#overwintered DC
