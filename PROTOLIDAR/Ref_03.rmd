#### Description 

LIDAR scan dataset in BBCH 65 (grapevine).Where x is width, y is height and z is front view or
path of the tractor.10
LIDAR_data

#### Usage 

data(LIDAR_data)

#### Format 

A data frame with 10108 observations on the following 3 variables.
* V1 a numeric vector that represents x value or width
* V2 a numeric vector that represents y value or height
* V3 a numeric vector that represents z value or front view

#### Details 

The laser scanner used was a LMS-200 model (Sick,Dusseldorf,Germany), a fully-automatic diver-
gent laser scanner based on the measurement of time-of-flight (TOF) with an accurancy of 15 mm
in a single shoot measurement and 5 mm standard deviation in a range upto 8m. The time between
the transmission and the reception of the pulsed near-infrared laser beam is used to measure the
distance between the scanner and the reflecting object surface. The laser beam is deflected by a
rotating mirror turning at 4500 rpm, which results in a fan shaped scan pattern where the maximum
scanning angle is 180 degree.

#### Examples 
<pre><code>
## LIDAR_data is the input to Extract_plant_grapevine_function.
data(LIDAR_data, package ='PROTOLIDAR')
x = LIDAR_data[,1]
y = LIDAR_data[,2]
z = LIDAR_data[,3]LWA_lidar_function

LWA_lidar_function
Leaf Wall Area (LWA) measured in m^2*ha^-1.
</code></pre>
#### Description 

LWA need as inputs the height of canopy (m) the ground area (generally one hectare, measured in
m^2) and the row spacing (m).

#### Usage 

LWA_lidar_function(height_canopy, ground_area, row_spacing)

#### Arguments 

* height_canopy height of canopy manually or measured with Height_canopy_function.
* ground_area is the orchard area measured in m^2, generally one hectare.
* row_spacing row spacing measured in meters.

#### Examples 

## Should be DIRECTLY executable !! ----
height_canopy = 2 ## this value is the maximum of Height_canopy_function.
ground_area = 10000 ## generally is one hectare in m^2.
row_spacing = 2.9 ## measured in meters.
## The function is currently defined as
function(height_canopy,ground_area,row_spacing){
LWA <- 2* height_canopy * (ground_area/row_spacing)
return(LWA)
}
LWA_lidar_function(height_canopy,ground_area,row_spacing)12
