The R package rLiDAR is an open-source tool for reading, processing and visualizing small sets of airborne lidar data. It was developed in 2014 and made publicly available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) in 2015. The rLiDAR package presents eight functions that allow ecologists, forest managers and scientists to i) import and visualize lidar data (e.g. Figure A1a); ii) smooth, detect and delineate individual trees on the lidar-derived canopy height model (e.g., Figure A1b-d), iii) compute lidar metrics at plot and crown levels (e.g., Figure A1d-g), and iv) plot virtual forest stands (e.g., Figure A1h1-h3). Since we developed the rLiDAR, additional open-source R packages for lidar data processing and visualization have been developed, such as lidR (Roussel et al. 2017) and ForestTools (Plowright 2017). rLiDAR was specifically developed to support the analysis presented in the Silva et al. (2016) with the goal of providing and testing a new framework for imputing individual tree attributes from field and lidar data in longleaf pine forests. However, the rLiDAR has general applicability to other forests in other ecosystems, and we encourage users to test it broadly.
