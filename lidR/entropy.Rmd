entropy
===========

***A normalized Shannon vertical complexity index***. 

* The Shannon diversity index is a measure for quantifying diversity and is based on the number and frequency of species present. 
* This index, developed by Shannon and Weaver for use in information theory, was successfully transferred to the description of species diversity in biological systems (Shannon 1948). 
* Here it is applied to quantify the diversity and the evenness of an elevational distribution of LiDAR points. 

It makes bins between 0 and the maximum elevation. If there are negative value the function returns NA. 

```{r]
library(lidR)

z = runif(10000, 0, 10)
# expected to be close to 1. 
entropy(z, by = 1)
```
The highest diversity is given for a uniform distribution

```{r}
 z = runif(10000, 9, 10)
entropy(z, by = 1)
# Must be 0. 
```
The lowest diversity is given for a unique possibility

```{r}
z = abs(rnorm(10000, 10, 1))

# expected to be between 0 and 1.
entropy(z, by = 1)
```
