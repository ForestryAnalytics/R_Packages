Individual tree segmentation
==============================================
The lastrees function has several algorithms from the literature for individual tree 
segmentation, based either on the digital canopy model or on the point-cloud. 

Each algorithm has been coded from the source article to be as close as possible to what was written in the peer-reviwed papers. 
Our goal is to make published algorithms usable, testable and comparable.

```{r}
las = readLAS("<file.las>")

lastrees(las, algorithm = "li2012")

col = random.colors(200)
plot(las, color = "treeID", colorPalette = col)
```
