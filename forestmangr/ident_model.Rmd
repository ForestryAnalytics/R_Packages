ident_model Identity of a Model Test
#### Description
Function for using the Identity of a Model test, as described by Regazzi (1999).
#### Usage
<pre><code>
ident_model(df, factor, reduced_model, filter = NA, output = "table",
gray_scale = FALSE, signif = 0.05, font = "serif")
</code></pre>

#### Arguments 
*``df``: A data frame.
* factor Quoted name of the factor variable used to differentiate the data projects in the
test.
* reduced_model Quoted or unquoted reduced model used in the test. The variables mentioned in the model must exist in the provided data frame. X and Y sides of the model
must be separated by "~".
* filter Optional argument. If supplied with levels present in factor, only these levels will be used in the test. NA.
output Defines the type of output. If "table" an anova table with the identity of model test is provided, if "plot" a ggplot plot/object representing the test is created, if
"table_plot", both anova table and plot are provided, and if "full", a list is provided, with details on the dummies variables created, the reduced and complete
models, the anova table and the plot. Default: "table"
* gray_scale If TRUE a gray scale will be used in the plots. Default: FALSE.
* signif Numeric value for the significance level used in the test. Default: 0.05.
* font font family used in the plots. Can be either "serif" for Times New Roman or "sans" for arial unicode MS. Default: "serif".


#### Examples
```{r}
library(forestmangr)
data("exfm13")
head(exfm13, 10)
# The objective is to know if the diameter's behavior is similar among 3 species.
# For this we'll use a quadratic model. We'll use nitrogen (N) as our X variable.
ident_model(exfm13, "species", dbh ~ N + N2)
# This test shows that there are differences between the species.
# We can get more #### Details on this using a different output, that will also
# give us a plot:
ident_model(exfm13, "species", dbh ~ N + N2, output = "table_plot")
# This gives us only the plot:
ident_model(exfm13, "species", dbh ~ N + N2, output = "table_plot")
# And this gives us additional information on the test:
ident_model(exfm13, "species", dbh ~ N + N2, output = "full")
# Looking at the plot, it seems that 2 species are behaving very similar, while
# the Pequi species is different from the other 2. We can confirm this by running
# the test in a paired fashion, using the filter argument:
ident_model(exfm13, "species", dbh ~ N + N2,
filter = c("PEQUI", "SUCUPIRA-PRETA"), output = "table_plot")
ident_model(exfm13, "species", dbh ~ N + N2,
filter = c("PEQUI", "VINHATICO"), output = "table_plot")
ident_model(exfm13, "species", dbh ~ N + N2,
filter = c("SUCUPIRA-PRETA", "PEQUI"), output = "table_plot")
ident_model(exfm13, "species", dbh ~ N + N2,
filter = c("SUCUPIRA-PRETA", "VINHATICO"), output = "table_plot")
# As we imagined, a single model can be used to describe the behavior of
# the "Sucupira-preta" and "Vinhatico" species,
# and a second model is needed to explain the Pequi Variable.
# It's possible to apply a gray scale to the plots, and also change it's font to arial:
ident_model(exfm13, "species", dbh ~ N + N2,output="plot",gray_scale=TRUE,font="sans")
```
#### Value
A data frame, a ggplot object, or a list, varying according to the output argument.
